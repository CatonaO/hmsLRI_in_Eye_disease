Genome Browser track hub

	UCSC Genome Browser
	The hmsLRI are available as a remote track hub for UCSC Genome Browser, the interactions are represented using
	different colors based on if the involved gene is a Green gene or an Amber gene
	You can browse them at: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgHubConnect?redirect=manual&source=genome.ucsc.edu
	Under the section "My Hubs" you can insert the following URL and add the Hub: https://github.com/CatonaO/UCSC_Track_hub_hmsLRI_in_Eye_disease/raw/main/UCSC_Genome_Browser_hub/hubDirectory/hub.txt
