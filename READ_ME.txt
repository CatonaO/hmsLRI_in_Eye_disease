OVERVIEW OF THE MATERIAL

CSV Files

The list of Green and Amber genes in Structural Eye disease has been downloaded from https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/panels/509/
version 1.3
Files contain human-mouse syntenic Long Range Interactions(hmsLRI) in which a green or amber gene is involved:

	"hmsLRI's_Promoter_within_Green_Genes.csv": List of hmsLRI in which the promoter anchor is the promoter of a Green Gene
	"hmsLRI's_Enhancer_within_Green_Genes.csv": List of hmsLRI in which the enhancer anchor is within a Green Gene region
	"hmsLRI's_Promoter_within_Amber_Genes.csv": List of hmsLRI in which the promoter anchor is the promoter of an Amber Gene
	"hmsLRI's_Enhancer_within_Amber_Genes.csv": List of hmsLRI in which the enhancer anchor is within a Amber Gene region
	
	

Genome Browser track hub

	UCSC Genome Browser
	The hmsLRI are available as a remote track hub for UCSC Genome Browser, the interactions are represented using
	different colors based on if the involved gene is a Green gene or an Amber gene
	You can browse them at: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgHubConnect?redirect=manual&source=genome.ucsc.edu
	Under the section "My Hubs" you can insert the following URL and add the Hub: https://github.com/CatonaO/UCSC_Track_hub_hmsLRI_in_Eye_disease/raw/main/UCSC_Genome_Browser_hub/hubDirectory/hub.txt
